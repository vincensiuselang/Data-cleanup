- Background color: A very light grayish teal (#f0f9f5), subtly desaturated to visually 'sit in the background' behind other UI elements.
- Accent color: Use a sky blue (#57a7ff) for interactive elements and highlights, to call attention and create contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif.
- Design custom icons for each feature, representing cleaning, AI, gaming, etc.
- Modular design to allow reuse of features as standalone pages/components. Consistent padding and spacing between elements.
